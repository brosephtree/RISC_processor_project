# RISC_processor_project

OVERVIEW

The objective of this project is to implement a RISC processor that handles data from external RAM.  The processor contains an ALU with 13 possible logical computations, and is controlled by a finite state machine that fetches, decodes, and implements the instructions stored in the RAM in 3 clock cycles.  This project comes with 3 instruction sets saved as coefficient files for instantiating the block RAM, which allows me to test whether or not the RISC processor is performing as intended.

TECHNOLOGY

This project is optimized for implementation on a Basys 3 board, which uses an Artix-7 FPGA from Xilinx. The Basys 3 includes enough switches, buttons, and 7-segment displays to allow a large number of designs—including the design of this project— to be completed without the need for any additional hardware.
